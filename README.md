# React Router v6 - Unexpected Route Behavior

This repository demonstrates a seemingly simple React Router v6 issue where a specific route within the `Routes` component behaves unexpectedly.  Other routes within the same application function correctly.

The problem appears to be related to the interaction between the routing logic and a specific component, although this interaction is not immediately obvious.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the problematic route (`/contact`).

Observe the incorrect rendering or lack of rendering on `/contact`, while `/` and `/about` work as expected.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`. This might involve a minor adjustment of component code, adjusting how routing is handled or a closer look at potential conflicts with other packages.
